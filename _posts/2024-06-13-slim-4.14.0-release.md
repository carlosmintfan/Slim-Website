We are pleased to have released Slim 4.14.0. As a mature release, there aren't many changes and all are minor and
can be seen [here](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/releases/tag/4.14.0).

## Type hinting with template generics

This release introduces of [template generic docblocks](https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-in-php-using-phpdocs) into Slim. If you type-hint `Slim\App` instance variable using `/** @var \Slim\App $app */`, then you will need to change it to either:

* `/** @var \Slim\App<null> $app */` if you are not using a DI container, or
* `/** @var \Slim\App<\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface> $app */` if you are.

You can also type-hint to the concrete instance of the container you are using too. For example, if you are using [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org), then you can use: `/** @var \Slim\App<DI\Container> $app */`.
